Feature: Search drivers
  As a user
  I should be able to get a list of drivers near me
  in order to know if I can get a cab

  Background:
    Given I send and accept JSON
    And the following drivers exist:
      | name              | taxi_number | latitude  | longitude    |
      | Juan Perez        | 5           | 19.264997 | -103.7108419 |
      | John Doe          | 22          | 19.265189 | -103.713567  |
      | Maria Guadalupe   | 10          | 19.269585 | -103.716614  |

  Scenario: Search drivers succesfully
    Given a user with phone number "+523121125642" exists
    And his authentication token is "foobar"
    And I set the request with the header "X-AUTHENTICATION-TOKEN" as "foobar"
    And I send a GET request to "/users/drivers" with the following:
    """
    {
      "latitude" : "19.264987",
      "longitude" : "-103.710863"
    }
    """
    Then the response status should be "200"
    And the JSON response should be:
    """
    {
      "status"  : "ok",
      "drivers" : [
